// "Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects."

// conventionally X plays first, so start condition could be choosing a gmae marker
// win condition: a row on 3 in any direction
// lose condition: computer has a row of 3 in any direction OR no more spaces to play (will avoid no more *winnable* spaces for now, and only look for a full board)
